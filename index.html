            <p>
                I am a 4th-year Biomedical <u>Engineering</u> student at the <u>University of Waterloo</u>, specializing in <u>Medical Artificial Intelligence</u>. As a Machine Learning Research Intern and Developer, Iâ€™ve worked at several tech startups and research labs, building AI-powered systems for explainable lung ultrasound diagnostics, enhancing AI testing with foundation models and LLMs, and developing computer vision pipelines for humanoid robots.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I contribute to research work at the <u>Critical Machine Learning Lab</u>, focusing on making models adaptable to new environments. I am also working with <u>Deep Breathe</u> to explore use of Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to guide sonography procedures.
